<br />
If you have a problem where the customer session will not expire and/or the admin panel session expires every few days, then this addon will fix it.<br />
<br />
This contribution's application-level session expiration directives will override those of the server-side.<br />
<br />
I made this for BootStrap Edge, but it will likely work with other versions of osC. I only tested it on BS Edge. <br />
<br />
1 database change, and 2 easy file changes. <br />

This is the full package.<br />
